# Scala DOM Test Utils
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.raquo/domtestutils_sjs0.6_2.13.svg)


_Scala DOM Test Utils_ provides a convenient, type-safe way to assert that a real Javascript DOM node matches a certain description using an extensible DSL.

    "com.raquo" %%% "domtestutils" % "0.12.0"  // Scala.js 1.x only
    "com.raquo" %%% "domtestutils" % "0.10.1"  // Scala.js 0.6.x only

The types of DOM tags, attributes, properties and styles are provided by [Scala DOM Types](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-types), but you don't need to be using that library in your application code, _Scala DOM TestUtils_ can test any DOM node no matter how it was created. 

You can use _Scala DOM Test Utils_ either directly to make assertions, or you if you're writing a DOM construction / manipulation library, to power its own test utils package. 



## Example Test

```scala

// Create a JS DOM node that you want to test (example shows optional Scala DOM Builder syntax)
val jsDomNode: org.scalajs.dom.Node = div(
  rel := "yolo"
  span("Hello, "),
  p("bizzare ", a(href := "http://y2017.com", "2017"), span(" world")),
  hr
).ref 
 
// Mount the DOM node for testing
mount(jsDomNode, "optional clue to show on failure")
 
// Assert that the mounted node matches the provided description (this test will pass given the input above)
expectNode(
  div like(
    rel is "yolo", // Ensure that rel attribute is "yolo". Note: assertions for properties and styles work similarly 
    span like "Hello, ", // Ensure the this element contains just one text node: "Hello, "
    p like (
      "bizzare ",
      a like (
        href is "http://y2017.com",
        title.isEmpty, // Ensure that title attribute is not set
        "2017"
      ),
      span like " world"
    ),
    hr // Just check existence of element and tag name. Equivalent to `hr like ()` 
  )
)
```

The above example defines `val jsDomNode` using [Scala DOM Builder](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-builder) which is a separate project, completely optional. It is a minimal, unopinionated library for building and manipulating Javascript DOM trees. You are free to create the DOM nodes that you want to test in any other way.

## Usage

Canonical usage is to `mount` one DOM node / tree (e.g. the output of your component) and then test it using the `expectNode` method.

Alternative is to call `expectNode(actualNode, expectedNode)`, for example if you only want to test a subtree of what you mounted.

If the mechanics of `MountOps` do not work for you, you can bypass `MountOps` altogether and just call `ExpectedNode.checkNode(actualNode)` directly to get a list of errors.

**With ScalaTest**: Your test suite should extend the `MountSpec[Any]` trait. Use `mount` and `expectNode` methods in your test code. You can call `unmount` and then `mount` again within one test if you want to test multiple unrelated nodes (e.g. different variations in a loop). `AsyncMountSpec` provides similar functionality for async tests.

**Without ScalaTest**: Write a tiny adapter like `MountSpec` for your test framework, which would:
 
- Extend `MountOps` and provide `doAssert` / `doFail` implementations specific to your test framework
- Call `resetDOM` in the beginning of each test, and `clearDOM` at the end of each test.

Pull requests for such adapters for popular test frameworks are welcome.

**To power your library's test utils**: If you are building or using a DOM construction / manipulation library like e.g. React, you might want to override the `mount` / `unmount` methods to give your library the chance to do proper setup and cleanup. Instead of calling super methods for these, you can make use of `assertEmptyContainer` / `assertRootNodeMounted` / `mountedElementClue` the same way they are used in the default implementations in `MountOps`.

For an example of the above, see [LaminarSpec](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/raquo/laminar/utils/LaminarSpec.scala), which defines custom mounting / unmounting logic for [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar)'s reactive nodes.

If all this is more hassle than it's worth for your use case, just forgo `MountOps` and drop down to calling `ExpectedNode.checkNode(actualNode)` to get a list of errors, and build your own test util around it.  



## TODO

* Docs: Add examples without Scala DOM Builder, in this library's own test suite
* Docs: Explain in more detail how to make assertions
* Docs: Explain the basics of Scala DOM Types node / attr / etc. types
* Docs: Explain how to create your own custom rules
* Docs: Document available assertions
* Feature: Add `anyChildren` and/or `maybeMoreChildren` to allow shallow / focused matching
